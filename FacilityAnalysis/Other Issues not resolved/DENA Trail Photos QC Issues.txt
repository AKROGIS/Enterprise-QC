ASSET Descriptions
==================

There are several assets where the trail name (in the asset description) does not match the trail name in the Location description.
❌ Concern is that some Assets may be under the wrong location, e.g. Some Savage Alpine (19980) wall assets may be under 19970 (Roadside).
See the attached CSV file (from this SQL) for details.

Photo QC
========

All Photo files have a point in the DENA_AllPhotos feature class.
All features (1222) in DENA_feat align with a feature in SDE features.
There are more features in SDE features than in DENA_feat.
 - Check for extra features on the trails mapped in 2015, and delete extras

There are 1222 features (collected in 2015), but only 1203 (file and location),
so I would expect 19 features to not have a photo.
A spatial query reveals that there are 63 features without a photo.  What happened?

✔  Oxbow trail (103121) has 3 features, 0 photos, and spatially 3 features do not have a photo
✔  HQ trail (111187) has 6 features, 6 photos, but spatially 1 feature does not have a photo
   - found 1 dup ✔
   - The south trail end has two photos 12:09:48 and 12:15:58. 
   - The second photo belongs on the Kennels 19970 trail head feature @12:15:56 without a photo
   - Sign at north end has no photo (It is on the trail end of the Kennel Trail)
   - FIXED: Moved dup to Kennel folder/feature
✔  Mountain Vista Trail (113057) has 32 features, 32 photos, but spatially 9 features do not have a photo
   - Found 8 dups ✔
   - Typically there are adjacent to the feature missing the photo
   - At time 1:13:4x, there are two nearly identical photos of the same sign (one is blurry)
   - There is no photo of the trail end (it is a missing photo point with no nearby dup)
   - The geojot report says there is no GPS point for the knack box (food locker), this is not true.
   - FIXED: Moved 8 dups to adjacent features without photo; deleted blurry photo
✔  Healy Overlook trail (19975) has 78 features, 78 photos, but spatially 1 feature does not have a photo
   - found 1 dup ✔
   - The next feature (downhill) has two different photos on it.
   - FIXED: Moved dup to adjacent featurs without photo
✔  Savage Cabin Interpretive Trail (19977) has 25 features, 25 photos, and spatially 3 features do not have a photo
   - found 3 dups ✔
   - Two photos (sign and culvert) were put the sign, the culvert point is very close, @ 3:08:04 (West access point)
   - Two culvert photos were put on the East culvert, an none on the west culvert @ time 3:20 (middle north side of loop)
   - Two photos were put on the SE feature leaving the NW feature sans photo; @ 3:34 intersection of roadside trail.
   - FIXED: Moved 3 dups to adjacent features without photo
✔  Savage Canyon Trail (19978) has 112 features, 110 photos, and spatially 2 features do not have a photo
   - There are indeed two photos missing near the east parking lot; There are no dups.
   - Photo SAM_520 (I&M signs) not at the right location, needs to move from the trailhead feature to the west
   - Based on timestamps and photo content, there is no photo for the trailhead @1:19:24
   - Photo SAM_525 is correct, the feature is a 13 step stair, field crew incorrectly called it a 13 step water bar drain
   - There is no photo for the 42'x1' wood wall @1:30:36 adjacent to the stairs (SAM_525) - based on timestamps and photo content
   - I think this is an erroneos feature that should be removed (they thought the side rails for the stairs was a retaining wall)
   - Report says some photos mis-tagged; does not say any are missing.
   - FIXED: SAM_520 Moved; incorrect wall feature removed.
✔  Savage Alpine trail (19980) has 207 features, 209 photos, but spatially 24 features do not have a photo
   - The west side of the trail, done 8/24 matches well, checking timestamps, count, and content.
   - The east side (8/25) is a mess.  There are ~24 dups and 1 triple.  This is 26 extra photos (for 24 missing w/ 2 extra)
   - Time stamps do not match very well, many photos were close in time/location and content is similar.
   - They were manually reviewed in order taken, with the features in the order collected, and the match was fairly obvious, with the following exceptions:
   - There is a source photo called SAM_EXTRA between SAM_1643 and SAM_1644 (with an appropriate date taken time).  How does that happen?
   - Photo SAM_EXTRA is a duplicate of SAM_1641, and is in error, and will be removed.
   - Photo SAM_1733 @2:15 has no feature. It appears to be a swale in the trail it is just uphill of SAM_1732 (a rock is in both)
   - A new manual feature should be created for SAM_1733, or both photos added to the same feature, or deleted.
   - 98 photos SAM_1640 to SAM_1739 (100) minus SAM_1683 and SAM_1732 are assigned to 98 sequential features.
   - Photo SAM_1683 does not exist; SAM_EXTRA is extra, which matches the 100 photos in the filesystem.
   - FIXED: All photos on 8/25 reassigned to correct feature, one feature has two photos.
✔  Kennels Trail (19986) has 15 features, 15 photos, but spatially, 1 feature does not have a photo
   - found 1 dup ✔
   - Kennels trail end has two photos; and the trail head is missing a photo.
   - Kennels photo (19986__7-7-2015 12-50-28 PM.JPG) belongs on the HQ sign feature without a photo.
   - The extra HQ photo belongs on the Kennels trail head
   - FIXED: Moved dup to HQ folder/feature
✔  Blueberry Hill Trail (19989) has 9 features, 8 photos, and spatially 1 feature does not have a photo
   - One trail end (intermediate access point) does not have a photo (that is correct)
   - However, there are two nearly identical pictures of the wood walkway near the NW end @12:20 (last two photos).
   - The NW trail end should have no photo, but it has the wood walk photo attached.
   - FIXED: move photo of wood walk from trail end to wood walk (feature now has two photos)
✔  Eielson Alpine Trail (19993) has 62 features, 62 photos, and spatially 1 feature does not have a photo
   - No photo at 12:16:00 (rock drain near top of trail); no dups nearby.
   - Photo 19993_469082_8-13-2015 11-16-12 AM.JPG, does not have a REAL GPS location.  It was incorrectly attached to the prior GPS point
   - FIXED: Created a new feature based on photo and moved photo to feature.
✔  Savage Roadside Trail (231390) has 10 features, 8 photos, and spatially 2 features do not have a photo
   - One feature was added manually after the fact and has no photo.
   - No photo taken at the trail end
   - GeoJot report says 2 photos are missing.
✔  Denali bike trail (83277) has 46 features, 31 photos, and spatially 15 features do not have a photo
   - Note the geojot report says 14 photos are missing, I think that is a typo


All of these photo repairs were done in SDE on the ATTACH table, the DENA_AllPhotos working FC is now obsolete.


Miscellaneous QC
================

❌ At intersection of Rock Creek Trail and Meadow View Trail (83278), there are two signs 1494137 (meadow view is not mapped)
   Not sure it the sign belongs to Rock Creek or Meadow View, and both trails currently GIS matches FMSS (2 signs for Rock Creek, and 1 for Meadow View)
✔  Remove Mountain vista shelter from trail features (it is a location) - reassign/retag photos.
❌ Trail 19970 (C Camp to HQ) has been rerouted to stay on the north side of the bridge since 2015 survey.  Fix GIS.
